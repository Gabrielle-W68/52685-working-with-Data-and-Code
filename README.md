## Features
- Double-Jump Mechanic: Players can press jump twice to reach higher platforms, adding depth to the platforming experience.
- Enemy AI: Basic enemies patrol a designated path, and certain enemies switch to pursuit mode when the player enters their range.
- Collectibles & Traps: Coins boost the playerâ€™s score and serve as guides through the maze, but some may also lead to traps.
- Physics-Based Jumping: The game incorporates realistic gravity and momentum in its jumping mechanics, allowing players to perform precise jumps. The gravity setting adds a more natural feel to character movements.
