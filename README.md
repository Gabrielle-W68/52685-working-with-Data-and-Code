## Technologies Used
- MakeCode Arcade - for game development and visual scripting
- JavaScript - within MakeCode Arcade for game logic and mechanics


## Features
- Double-Jump Mechanic: Players can press jump twice to reach higher platforms, adding depth to the platforming experience.
- Enemy AI: Basic enemies patrol a designated path, and certain enemies switch to pursuit mode when the player enters their range.
- Collectibles & Traps: Coins boost the playerâ€™s score and serve as guides through the maze, but some may also lead to traps.
- Physics-Based Jumping: The game incorporates realistic gravity and momentum in its jumping mechanics, allowing players to perform precise jumps. The gravity setting adds a more natural feel to character movements.

## Setup
1.Download or clone the repository.
2.Open MakeCode Arcade and import the project files.
3.Ensure any required MakeCode Arcade extensions for sprites and animations are installed.


## Usage
Movement: Use arrow keys to move the character left or right.
Jumping: Press the jump key once or twice to navigate platforms and evade enemies.
Goal: Collect coins to increase score and locate the treasure chest to unlock the next level.

`// Example Code for Double Jump
if (hero.isHittingGround()) {
    canDoubleJump = true;
}
if (jumpPressed && canDoubleJump) {
    hero.vy = jumpVelocity;
    canDoubleJump = false;
}`
